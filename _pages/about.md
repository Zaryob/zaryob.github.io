A comrade devoted to free software and open source.

Founder and Manager of SulinOS Project.

My hobbies are photography (bird photography and abstract photography), hiking and cycling. 

In front of the computer, my favorite things are to translate documentation to open source projects, port legacy codes and python2 codes and create alternatives.

I'm a retro computers fan and a retro gamer. Due to the high cost of retro computers, I have been playing many cartridge programs and ROMs with Retropie installed on my Raspberry Pi 4 (my favorite game Star Ocean - Till the End of Time).

Above all, I am a person trying to be a virtuous person until the end of the time life bestowed on me.
